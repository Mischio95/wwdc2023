# WWDC2023 Fallingnote

Game for Swift Playground, iPadOS and iOS

I chose to make a music rhythm game for iPadOS as an experience that challenges players to match a pentagram to a falling note with the same color. 
The game's primary focus is rhythm and timing, requiring players to be quick and react to the falling notes. 
One of the standout features for me is that by using SwiftUI and the SpriteKit framework I was able, apart from the game-making itself, to implement colorblindness palettes for inclusivity.
Taking a thoughtful approach to design by considering the needs of different kinds of players. 
The game utilizes color palettes that are optimized for colorblind individuals, allowing them to enjoy the game without any limitations or frustration. 
Additionally, I used the GarageBand app to create the music notes for the game. 
This adds an extra layer of authenticity and immersion to the experience, as players can hear the actual music notes that they're matching on the pentagram. 
For the assets Iâ€™ve enjoyed using Sketch for the versatility that it gave me to create the assets as I imagined them.
